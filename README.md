# Flipkart Login Page Design

This project is a simple front-end implementation of a Flipkart-like login page using HTML and CSS. The design is focused on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, similar to the login page found on the Flipkart website.

## Project Structure

**index.html**: This is the main HTML file that structures the login page. It includes the layout and elements like input fields, buttons, and text, all wrapped within a container.

**style.css**: The internal CSS within the HTML file provides the styling for the login page. It includes styles for the container, form elements, and typography.

## Features

 **Responsive Design**: The page is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it adjusts well on different screen sizes.

**Flexbox Layout**: The layout is created using CSS Flexbox, making it easier to align and distribute space among the items in the container.

**Floating Labels**: The input fields utilize floating labels that transition smoothly when the user interacts with the input fields.

**Custom Button Design**: A custom button style is implemented to mimic the appearance of a Flipkart login page.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flipkart-login-page.git
   

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   
   cd flipkart-login-page
   

3. **Open `index.html`** in your preferred browser to view the login page.

## Customization

- You can change the background image used in the `.form-text` section by replacing the `background.png` file with your own image. Ensure the image path in the CSS is updated accordingly.

- Modify the colors, fonts, and other styles in the CSS to match your preferences or branding.
